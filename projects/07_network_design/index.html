In particular, a hub is a type of facility used to consolidate the flow from multiple sources to leverage economies of scale in the transportation. These are used in multiple situations, such as in passenger transportation <img class="emoji" title=":walking:" alt=":walking:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f6b6.png" height="20" width="20"> (both in land and air), cargo <img class="emoji" title=":truck:" alt=":truck:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f69a.png" height="20" width="20">, postal mail delivery <img class="emoji" title=":mailbox:" alt=":mailbox:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4eb.png" height="20" width="20"> (before e-mail was invented though), public services <img class="emoji" title=":fire_engine:" alt=":fire_engine:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f692.png" height="20" width="20"><img class="emoji" title=":police_car:" alt=":police_car:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f693.png" height="20" width="20"><img class="emoji" title=":ambulance:" alt=":ambulance:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f691.png" height="20" width="20">, and more.</p> <p>In this project there are 3 types of arcs where different logistic activities occur: collection, transference and distribution, which you can see in the next figure.

We assume there are other companies in the market, and so to compete properly, this new company will provide a guaranteed time delivery service for all origin-destination pairs. To do this it will localize some hubs, assign cities to hubs and determine which hubs are going to be connected to each other. The demand is given by all pairs of origin-destination cities, and the proposed network has to comply with:</p> <ul> <li>Cargo must be transported through hubs, in other words, it is not allowed to transport directly between nodes that are not hubs.</li> <li>There is no capacity constraints in the hubs or in the arcs.</li> <li>Each origin-destination flow must pass through at least 1 and maximum 2 hubs.</li> <li>Each customer must be assigned to a single hub for simplicity of management.</li> <li>The latest arrival time to from every origin to every destination has to be at most \(\beta\) hours.</li> <li>Every hub, before transporting cargo to other hubs, must wait for all its assignated customers to bring their cargo to consolidate. In other words, the departuring time of a hub when going to other hub is equivalent to the latest arrival of cargo from its assignated customers.</li> <li>Every hub, before delivering cargo to its customers, must wait for all incoming cargo from other hubs to consolidate. In other words, the departuring time of a hub when going to its customers is equivalent to the latest arrival of cargo from other hubs.</li> <li>There is no time needed to consolidate cargo.</li> <li>The demand is fixed and inelastic to the service level offered.</li> <li>For simplicity, I will assume that only the top \(k=20\) largest provinces are available to locate hubs.</li> </ul> <p>The costs to consider are:</p> <ul> <li>Fixed cost of locating a hub in a particular province.</li> <li>Fixed cost of establishing a connection between 2 hubs or between a province and a hub.</li> <li>Cost of transporting cargo on each arc of the network (collection, transfer and distribution) per unit of distance.</li> <li>Economy of scale factor \(\alpha\) of using large and specialized trucks between hubs (for instance 10% cheaper and 10% faster).</li> </ul> <p>Turkey is an interesting case of study because:</p> <ul> <li>There are no clear simmetries in the demand (north v/s south, or east v/s west)</li> <li>There are big nodes of supply/demand distributed across the country (the biggest node, for instance, is Istanbul located in the northwest)</li> <li>The country has a reasonable infrastructure for land transportation, allowing the possibility of every province to be connected to the network.</li> </ul> <p>In the following picture you can see the 81 provinces of Turkey.</p> <div class="row"><div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/network_design/turkey_provinces.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="700" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture><figcaption class="caption">Source: Tan and Kara (2007)</figcaption> </figure> </div></div> <p>I discretized this continous representation into a set of nodes, all connected to each other by the highways of the country.

This is because the number of hubs required decreased (which was the major component of the cost).</li> <li>This analysis could be useful for a company when evaluating the impact of a new technology providing faster or cheaper transport when consolidating cargo.</li> </ul> <h2 id="5-extensions"><strong>5 Extensions</strong></h2> <p>This problem exhibits several dimensions to be extended, for instance:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Faster solution methods</strong>: because we have \(O(n^2)\) binary variables and \(O(n^3)\) continuous variables, a descomposition approach such as Benders could be applied here.</li> <li> <strong>More complex operational design</strong>: capacity constraints could be added, elasticity in the demand and different service levels among pairs of origin-destination</li> <li> <strong>Dynamic models instead of static</strong>: the decision of localizing a facility is a strategic decision which should be evaluated in financial terms for a long term horizon. This could be added as well, with a demand forecast and with the financial characteristic for this company. Also, the fixed costs in a dynamic model could weight less because of the potential gains in operational expenses in the future.</li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Francisco Zenteno Smith. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-0R41J5CTCW"></script> <script>function gtag(){window.dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-0R41J5CTCW");</script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
