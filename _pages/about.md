I am an engineer with +8 years of experience in applied mathematics for industries such as retail, manufacturing and healthcare. I have outstanding communication abilities, problem-solving skills, a growth-oriented mindset, and the ability to work and lead multidisciplinary teams. I am polishing my computer science skills by getting a Master's degree at UCSD, where I am concentrating on Machine Learning, AI and Computer Vision. Looking forward to applying my experience in problem-solving and my computer science skills to solve real-world problems.

### **News**

#### October 2023: Joined Professor Nikolay Atasanov Lab
Started to work on a cool project related to estimating simultaneouly the pose, shape and material of an object. This could be
used for downstream robotic applications.

#### June 2023: CVPR in Vancouver
I attended my first AI conference, where I had the opportunity to witness firsthand the direction in which the forefront of Computer Vision research is heading.

### **Awards**
##### :trophy: Full Scholarship (2022)
Government of Chile\
Awarded to complete my Master program at UCSD

##### :trophy: Top 4% in Kaggle Competition (2016)
Kaggle\
'Santa Stolen Sleigh' was a huge NP-Hard problem related to a Vehicle Routing Problem with capacity constraints. I designed a meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (in C#) and run it on a server. Got position #40 among 1000 participants.

##### :trophy: GOCup 3rd place (2014)
Complex Engineering Systems Institute\
Competition to solve a NP-Hard problem with more than 500 graduate students partipants. I designed a meta-heuristic based on Tabu Search for a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

##### :trophy: Best Teaching Assistant (2013)
Transport and Logistics Department, School of Engineering, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile\
"For his dedication and commitment to teaching"
