Hi! I am an engineer with +8 years of experience and a former entrepreneur. I am currently a second-year Master Student in Computer Science at [UCSD](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) :mortar_board:, with an expected graduation on June 2024. I like to build **Computer Vision** models using **Deep Learning** with good **Software Engineering** principles.

<br>
### **Technical Skills**
Mathematical Modelling: Deep Learning, Integer Programming, Simulation <br>
Softwares: Tensorflow, Pytorch, CPLEX <br>
Languajes: Python, Java, C#, Rust, C, SQL, AMPL

<br>
### **Non-technical Skills**
Problem structuring, Communication, Leadership, Negotiation, Ability to work with multidisciplinary teams.

<br>
### **Awards**
##### :trophy: Full Scholarship (2022)
Government of Chile\
Awarded to complete my Master program at UCSD

##### :trophy: Top 4% in Kaggle Competition (2016)
Kaggle\
'Santa Stolen Sleigh' was a huge NP-Hard problem related to a Vehicle Routing Problem with capacity constraints. I designed a meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (in C#) and run it on a server. Got position #40 among 1000 participants.

##### :trophy: GOCup 3rd place (2014)
Complex Engineering Systems Institute\
Competition to solve a NP-Hard problem with more than 500 graduate students partipants. I designed a meta-heuristic based on Tabu Search for a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

##### :trophy: Best Teaching Assistant (2013)
Transport and Logistics Department, School of Engineering, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile\
"For his dedication and commitment to teaching"
