Hi! I'm a first-year Master Student in Computer Science at [UCSD](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) :mortar_board:. I have broad interests in the intersection between Software Engineering, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

In Computer Vision in particular, I'm interested in tasks like Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Action Detection and Object Tracking.
