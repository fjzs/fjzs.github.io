<br>
I am a data scientist with 6+ years of experience applying operations research within diverse sectors such as retail, manufacturing, and healthcare. I have a business-oriented mindset, outstanding communication, problem-solving skills and the capacity to work with multidisciplinary teams.

I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science to integrate the best software development principles to mathematical modeling techniques to improve project success.

<br>
### **Technical Skills**
**Operations Research**: Optimization (linear programming, mixed-integer programming, metaheuristics) and discrete-event simulation <br>
**Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C#, SQL, AMPL <br>
**Software-related**: CPLEX, Gurobi, Arena Simulation Software, Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Git, Linux, ROS.<br>
**Machine Learning**: Regression and classification<br>
**Computer Vision**: Tasks in 2D like image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.

### **Awards**
##### :trophy: Full Scholarship (2022)
Government of Chile\
Awarded to complete my Master program at UCSD

##### :trophy: Top 4% in Kaggle Competition (2016)
Kaggle\
'Santa Stolen Sleigh' was a huge NP-Hard problem related to a Vehicle Routing Problem with capacity constraints. I designed a meta-heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (in C#) and run it on a server. Got position #40 among 1000 participants.

##### :trophy: Operations Research Cup 3rd place (2016)
Complex Engineering Systems Institute (Chile)\
Competition to solve a NP-Hard problem with more than 500 graduate students from all over the country. I designed an algorithm for a stable matching problem.

##### :trophy: Operations Research Cup 3rd place (2014)
Complex Engineering Systems Institute (Chile)\
Competition to solve a NP-Hard problem with more than 500 graduate students from all over the country. I designed a meta-heuristic based on Tabu Search for a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

##### :trophy: Best Teaching Assistant (2013)
Transport and Logistics Department, School of Engineering, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile\
"For his dedication and commitment to teaching".
