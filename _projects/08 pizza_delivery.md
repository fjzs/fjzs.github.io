This is the project from the course CSE 203B Convex Optimization from UCSD.

Repository here: <https://github.com/fjzs/pizza_delivery>

The problem tackled in this project is the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**. The purpose of this project for me was to get hands on experience in column generation techniques.

Coming soon...
